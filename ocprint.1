.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBocprint\fP
takes an OPeNDAP source (via a URL) and prints various kinds of information from that source.
Independent of the options, 
\fBocprint\fP
will always attempt to obtain a DAS and DDS.
Failures will be reported but ignored.
The DATADDS will only be accessed if explicitly requested using the \fI-p datadds\fP option.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB-A\fP"
Print attributes along with the DDS if \fI-g\fP is specified.
.IP "\fB-D \fRdebug-arg\fP"
Set a variety of debug options; this flag may be repeated multiple times.
The current set of values is as follows.
.RS
.IP "\fB-Dn\fP"
Set the debug level to \fIn\fP.
.IP "\fB-DC\fP"
Set curl library debugging.
.IP "\fB-DD\fP"
Dump the datadds tree.
.IP "\fB-DN\fP"
Dump the dds tree.
.IP "\fB-DXn\fP"
Equivalent to -DD and settin the dump level to n.
.IP "\fB-DV\fP"
Set verbose output.
.RE
This option may be used multiple times.
.IP "\fB-G\fP"
Force \fI-p\fP flag to generate the DAS and/or DDS
from the internal parse tree instead of just
dumping the text sent by the server. Defaults to on.
.IP "\fB-L\fP"
Turn on logging output.
.IP "\fB-N\fP"
Specify the path to use to find the netrc file.
This should be a path to the netrc file, not the containing directory.
.IP "\fB-R\fP"
Specify the path to use to find the rc file.
This should be a path to the rc file, not the containing directory.
If not specified, then the search order is
\fI./.ocrc\fP \fI~/.ocrc\fP,
\fI./.dodsrc\fP \fI~/.dodsrc\fP.
.IP "\fB-S\fP"
Specify that the server certificate is not checked
when using https protocol.
This is mostly intended to be used when the server
is using a self-signed certificate.
.IP "\fB-h\fP"
Output usage information, including a list of command line options.
.IP "\fB-p \fRall|das|dds|data|datadds\fP"
Cause the DAS, the DDS, or the DATADDS to be printed.
The argument \fIdata\fP is a synonym for \fIdatadds\fP.
The  \fIall\fP case causes all three to be printed.
This option may be used multiple times.
.IP "\fB[-u|-f] OPeNDAP-URL\fP"
Specify the url source from which to read. The -u or -f is optional.
.SH URL Format
The url has two parts.
.IP "1."
The body of the url, such as
\fIhttps://remotetest.unidata.ucar.edu/dts/test.69.dds\fP.
.IP "2."
The optional constraint, such as
\fI?f[0:2:16][120]\fP.
This follows the body.
See the DAP2 specification for details on the general constraint format.
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
Extract everything from a specific URL (note: URL is fake).
.RS
.nf
ocprint -p all http://test.opendap.org/test1
.RE
