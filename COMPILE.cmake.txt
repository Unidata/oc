Building OC with CMake
**************************

This document describes how to use CMake to configure and build the
OC-C libraries across different platforms.

************
Introduction
************

We have recently introduced CMake support into the OC
trunk. Using CMake, it is possible to build the OC libraries
natively on Windows using Visual Studio. CMake also provides
an alternative build system to autotools (except for
testing).  CMake works on Unix, Linux and Windows system,
and will generate files for a variety of build systems.

- Operating System: Any/All: Unix Makefiles, CodeBlocks, Eclipse CDT
- Windows: Borland Makefiles, MSYS Makefiles, MinGW Makefiles, Visual
- Studio Projects (Versions 6+) Linux: Ninja, KDevelop3 OSX: Xcode

************************************
Requirements for building with CMake
************************************

1. OC (2.0 or later) with CMake support:
a) Subversion: svn co
	https://scm.opendap.org/svn/trunk/oc
2. CMake 2.8.8+ for your platform of choice. http://www.cmake.org

Out-of-source Builds
********************

The CMake build system discourages 'in-source' builds. Instead, a
build directory is created and used to contain the output of the build
process. From the command line, this may be achieved as follows:

developer@dummy-machine: cd oc2.0
developer@dummy-machine: mkdir build_dir
developer@dummy-machine: cd build_dir
developer@dummy-machine: cmake ..

Compiling the OC Libraries and Utilities
********************************************************

CMake provides different 'Generators'; these define the build system
which will be used to build the OC libraries. On Unix/Linux, the
default generator is 'Unix Makefiles':

developer@dummy-machine: cd oc2.0/build_dir
developer@dummy-machine: cmake .. 
developer@dummy-machine: make

On windows, the default generator is for Visual Studio based
builds. CMake is invoked the same way: C:...\build_dir>cmake ..

The resulting project files can be opened in Visual Studio, or you
can compile from the command line using CMake as an intermediary:

cd build_dir
cmake --build . 

Note: If you want to use a different generator than the default, you
would specify it with the '-G' flag.

Testing the OC Libraries and Utilities
********************************************************
Currently testing uses the GNU Autotest framework
and so testing under CMake is not supported (yet).

Common OC/CMake Options
*********************

- BUILD_SHARED_LIBS (Off by Default for Windows, 
                     On by Default for Unix/Linux) 
- ENABLE_DLL (Windows Only, Off by Default)
- CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH

This is just a partial list of options available. To see a full list
of options, run 'cmake -L' from the command line, or use a CMake GUI.

To specify an option with CMake, you would use the following syntax:

developer@dummy-machine: cd oc2.0/build_dir
developer@dummy-machine: cmake .. -D"BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON"

Additional References
*********************

CMake is a very robust build system.  For additional syntax and
options, see the CMake website, FAQ and Wiki available at
<http://www.cmake.org>.
