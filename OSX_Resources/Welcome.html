<h2>About the OPeNDAP C API Library Package</h2>

<p>The OPeNDAP C API (oc) provides a set of C-language type definitions 
and functions that can be used to retrieve data over the internet from
servers that implement the OPeNDAP Data Access Protocol (DAP 2.0).
The oc implementation provides a low-overhead way to retrieve this data,
making it practical to include OPeNDAP capability in relatively simple
software.</p>

<p>Included in the oc distribution is: 
<ul>
<li><tt>C-language API library</tt></li>
<li><tt>a standalone example application <b>octest</b></tt></li></ul>
</p>

<p>This package is required for other Mac OS/X packages
  OPeNDAP has written. By default it will use <tt>/usr</tt> as
  the base directory for installation.</p>
