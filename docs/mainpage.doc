The oc library is a completely new implementation of the client side OPeNDAP
data retrieval system. It has the following properties.
<ul>
<li>It is completely implemented in C; no C++ is required.
<li>It completely replaces the previous OCAPI system.
<li>It provides a complete API that does not require knowledge
of the internals of OC. This interface was strongly influenced
by the netCDF interface.
</ul>
<p>
Version 2.0 introduces a completely new access model that
provides a clearer and simpler API.
<p>
The oc library  was developed by
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu">Unidata</a>
and the
<a href="http://opendap.org">Opendap Consortium</a>
under a joint grant funded by the National Science Foundation.
