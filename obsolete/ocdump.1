.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBoctest\fP
takes an OPeNDAP source (via a URL) and prints various kinds of information from that source.
Independent of the options, 
\fBoctest\fP
will always attempt to obtain a DAS and DDS.
Failures will be reported but ignored.
The DATADDS will only be accessed if explicitly requested using \fI-p datadds\fP
option.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB-B\fP"
Produce the output in a form using nested curly brackets;
default is off.
.IP "\fB-C \fRconstraint\fP"
Specify the constraint to be used when the DATADDS is read.
.IP "\fB-g\fP"
Force \fI-p\fP flag to generate the DAS and/or DDS
from the internal parse tree instead of just
dumping the text sent by the server.
.IP "\fB-m\fP"
Store the data from the data dds in memory instead of in a temporary
file. As always, there is speed/space tradeoff.
.IP "\fB-A\fP"
Print attributes along with the DDS if \fI-g\fP is specified.
The -M flag is an older alias for -A, but -M is deprecated.
.IP "\fB-p \fRall|das|dds|data|datadds\fP"
Cause the DAS, the DDS, or the DATADDS to be printed.
The argument \fIdata\fP is a synonym for \fIdatadds\fP.
The  \fIall\fP case causes all three to be printed.
This option may be used multiple times.
.IP "\fB-U \fRuser-parameters\fP"
Prefix the given parameters to the front of the OPeNDAP URL
before accessing it. The general form is param=value.
.IP "\fB-v\fP"
Output extra information about processing.
.IP "\fB-L\fP"
Turn on logging output.
.IP "\fB-D \fRdebug-arg\fP"
Set a variety of debug options; this flag may be repeated multiple times.
See \fIocdump.c\fP for a detailed description.
.IP "\fB-f \fROPeNDAP-URL\fP"
Specify the url source from which to read. The -f is optional.
